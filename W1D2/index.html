    <h2><a name="description" />What is Macaroni and Cheese?</h2>
        <p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaroni_and_cheese" target="_blank">Macaroni and cheese</a> also called mac and cheese or mac n cheese in American and Canadian English, can sometimes be called macaroni pie in Caribbean English, and macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom — is a dish of English origin, consisting of cooked macaroni pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar.

        It can also incorporate other ingredients, such as breadcrumbs, meat and vegetables. Traditional macaroni and cheese is a casserole baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix. The cheese is often first incorporated into a Béchamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is then added to the pasta. In the United States, it is considered a comfort food.</p>
